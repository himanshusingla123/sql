# What are purpose of cast and substring in sql
1. **CAST/CONVERT Function:**
   - The `CAST` or `CONVERT` functions in SQL are used to convert a value from one data type to another. For example:
     ```sql
     SELECT CAST(column_name AS VARCHAR(10)) FROM table_name;
     ```
     This converts the values in `column_name` to VARCHAR with a maximum length of 10 characters.

2. **SUBSTRING Function:**
   - The `SUBSTRING` function is used to extract a portion of a string. It takes three arguments: the string, the starting position, and the length of the substring. For example:
     ```sql
     SELECT SUBSTRING(column_name, 1, 3) FROM table_name;
     ```
     This extracts a substring of length 3, starting from the first character of the values in `column_name`.

# How to select two columns from two different tables having same id
To select two columns from two different tables based on a common ID, you can use the `JOIN` clause. Assuming you have two tables, let's call them `table1` and `table2`, and they both have a column named `id` that serves as the common identifier, you can use a query like this:

```sql
SELECT table1.column_name1, table2.column_name2
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
```

Replace `column_name1` and `column_name2` with the actual column names you want to select. This query uses an `INNER JOIN` to match rows with the same `id` values in both tables and selects the specified columns from each table.

If you want to include all rows from one table and matching rows from the other (even if there is no match), you can use a `LEFT JOIN`:

```sql
SELECT table1.column_name1, table2.column_name2
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
```

Adjust the query based on your specific requirements and database structure.

# How to calculate the maximum of numbers  in a table in sql
To calculate the maximum of numbers in a column of a table in SQL, you can use the `MAX` aggregate function. Assuming you have a table named `your_table` and a column named `your_column`, the query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT MAX(your_column) AS max_number
FROM your_table;
```

This query calculates the maximum value of the numbers in the specified column and aliases the result as `max_number`. Adjust the table name (`your_table`) and column name (`your_column`) according to your actual table structure.

If you want to find the maximum value for each group based on another column (for example, if you have a grouping column), you can use the `GROUP BY` clause along with the `MAX` function:

```sql
SELECT grouping_column, MAX(your_column) AS max_number
FROM your_table
GROUP BY grouping_column;
```

Replace `grouping_column` with the column you want to use for grouping. This query will give you the maximum value for each group.

# How to add one in particular column and print it
To add one to a particular column in a row and print the result, you can use an `UPDATE` statement in SQL. Here's an example assuming you have a table named `your_table` with a column named `your_column` and you want to increment the value in `your_column` for a specific row:

```sql
-- Increment the value in your_column by 1 for a specific row (e.g., where id = 1)
UPDATE your_table
SET your_column = your_column + 1
WHERE id = 1;

-- Print the updated value for verification
SELECT your_column
FROM your_table
WHERE id = 1;
```

Replace `your_table`, `your_column`, and `id` with your actual table name, column name, and the condition that identifies the row you want to update. This example increments the value in `your_column` by 1 for the row where `id` is equal to 1 and then selects and prints the updated value.

Make sure to adjust the query based on your specific table structure and requirements.

# If we have to take average of two columns and print the name column of that table
To calculate the average of two columns and print the values from another column in the same table, you can use a SELECT statement along with the AVG() function. Here's an example assuming you have a table named `your_table` with columns `column1`, `column2`, and `name`:

```sql
SELECT name, (column1 + column2) / 2 AS average_value
FROM your_table;
```

This query calculates the average of `column1` and `column2` for each row and selects the `name` column along with the computed average. The `(column1 + column2) / 2` expression calculates the average of the two columns.

Adjust the table and column names according to your actual table structure.

# Type of all joins
There are several types of joins in SQL, each serving a different purpose. The main types of joins are:

1. **INNER JOIN:**
   - Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
   ```

2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):**
   - Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
   ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):**
   - Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
   ```

4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):**
   - Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table1 FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
   ```

5. **CROSS JOIN:**
   - Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
   ```

6. **SELF JOIN:**
   - Joins a table with itself. This is useful when you want to compare rows within the same table.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees e1, employees e2 WHERE e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
   ```

These are the fundamental types of joins in SQL. The choice of which join to use depends on the specific requirements of your query and the relationship between the tables.
